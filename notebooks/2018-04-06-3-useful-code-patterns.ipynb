    "\n",
    "Over the years I have found out how important it is to constantly challenge yourself. Coding is craftsmanship. A good craftsman will always try to improve the toolbox they use every day. Code patterns belong in any good toolbox.<!--more--> When used wisely, they allow anyone to clearly communicate their program's intent to both people and machines. Code is not just something that machines execute — it's also something that people read, understand, and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the programming patterns out there help make code better. ”Better“ in this case means that the program is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- easy to understand,\n",
    "- easy to extend, and\n",
    "- easy to fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, ”better“ code — from a machine perspective — is also:\n",
    "\n",
    "- quick to run,\n",
    "- reliably when it comes to handling errors and exceptions, and\n",
    "- efficient in using your computer's available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd like to share with you three powerful programming patterns in Python (and similar dynamic object-oriented programming languages) that can make a big difference when it comes to improving your code. Documents like the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) or the [Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) give lots of useful hints on improving your code's ability to communicate intent. The following code patterns are my personal favorites and can be found (one way or another) in many of the coding guidelines out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Flat, Not Nested\n",
    "\n",
    "The _Zen of Python_ tells you that flat is better than nested.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flat cose is better than nested code both in terms of how deeply woven your program's function call graph is and from from a practical point of view, how far indented your code ends up being. Emphasizing a sparse use of _nestedness_ will always lead to better code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flat code is also because layering too many paths of execution in your functions can make them hard to understand. Many paths obscure the _main_ path a program will take 99 % of the time and can distract by displaying the minutiae of error handling or data processing with the same priority given to the 2 or 3 lines of code that do most of the productive heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a web backend that updates user account data after performing a series of validations and input data verifications. In our imaginary example, the last step — updating user account data — can only happen if all the previous steps execute correctly."

The level of indentation decreases readability as well — scanning left to right with your eyes in order to continue downwards breaks the natural flow of reading code.\n",
