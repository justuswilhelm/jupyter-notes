    "I believe that being a data scientist is about communication first, and data science second. This means that two abilities are necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ability to gain insight and knowledge using data\n",
    "- The ability to successfully communicate what I learn to stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "I have always wanted to share some of my ideas for improving those abilities and have finally learned enough to know what to write for the first time. Therefore, I have written down some of the most important lessons that I have learned on my path to becoming a better data science communicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), [IPython](https://ipython.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) are my main tools, the article is written from the perspective of a user of these tools. There are three themes that will be covered in this article.\n",

    "2. __Notebook structure__\n",
    "3. __Clean Processing__\n",

It is not only about the right method call to parse a CSV column, it is also about clearly documenting how you found the data, and what you did with it. Again, we will see what to do and what to avoid."

    "# 2. Communicate with Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1. What question are you answering?\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing happens for a reason. This includes writing IPython notebooks, and data science writing in general. Think about the last time you wrote a notebook. Why did you write it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me name a few reasons why I create Data Science notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A client approaches me with their data and a question. I answer their question using their data and guide them on a business decision making process.\n",
    "- I develop a machine learning model and evaluate its performance. I want to explain how the model works and how it is evaluated, and how confident I am in the result.\n",
    "- I analyze data quality and want to summarize my findings. This allows me to better estimate the quality of subsequent data analysis.\n",
    "- There is a new data science concept that I want to understand and teach. It could be an addition to the Pandas API, it could be a new idea on Data Engineering, or it could be an interesting machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am sure there are many more reasons for using notebooks to share data science ideas and results. Knowing the purpose of a document allows me to quickly decide what to include and what not to include.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can add an infinite amount of subsegments when doing a segment analysis on user data. At the same time, looking at more data than necessary does not really help answer the original question of a document. Realizing that I am not working on solving the goal prompts me to get back to answering the core question in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps I am analyzing how conversion rate of new and returning users are different, but get sidetracked by some interesting subsegment of returning users. That may be valuable by itself, but it also deserves its own independent treatment. In that instance, I like mentioning interesting findings to the people I work with and I suggest that these findings are worth being analysed further in a new document. This is always received with enthusiasm. Working closely with data will always give you an edge at identifying further interesting topics to research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I believe that focusing on one main purpose maximizes the impact of the notebook's core result. Just providing one main chart that demonstrates an important finding has more value than a notebook containing several interesting but weaker findings. The presence of many results dilutes the impact of one result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the opposite: A document could completely lack interesting findings and never get close to answering any question. In that case, returning to answering the core question and dedicating all effort to effectively sharing results should have the highest priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum it up, a reader should always know what was asked and what was answered in a notebook."

    "## 2.2. How well could you answer the question?\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook is an answer to a question. The way a notebook answers this question comes in the form of a result. This result may be a chart, a table, or even a simple yes or no. What all those results have in common is something intangible: Quality. Not only does the result itself matter, but also the quality of that result. While I feel unable I would like to show a few examples of quality in notebooks. I will also show some examples where quality can be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delivering a __histogram__ clearly demonstrating an insight about user behavior has a strong quality. Furthermore, if the data is cleaned thoroughly, the split-apply-combine process is reproducible, the charts are well-formatted, and the explanation and summary are easy to understand, the document will be truly valuable for the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delivering a weak __yes__ to the question _\"Do our users exhibit behavior A\"_ lacks quality. Maybe the data source contained format errors, maybe the event data could only partially be joined with the user data, and maybe the explanation and summary do not clearly describe the process. All these factors together will make the document not useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "And yes, problems with data source quality can not always be avoided. Maybe the client changed the data storage format in the middle of the year, maybe a metric changed and it wasn't properly documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is something that can be done about this: __Clearly document data quality issues__ with the data at hand. Make the client aware that there are problems. But most importantly, present your results in such a way that quality issues and potential caveats are transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conclude that __strong results__ are a product of\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clean data processing,\n",
    "2. Reproducible and transparent computation, and\n",

    "\n",
    "Let us move on to the other half of answering _how well could you answer the question?_, the question of __feasibility__. Before we start working on answering a question, we need to ask ourselves whether\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the question can be solved using the tools and skills that are available, and\n",
    "2. whether the question is answerable at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a difference between questions that can be answered, and questions that can't be answered. It is not always possible to know whether a question can be answered when you start working on it. At the same time, you should always question yourself how confident you are given what you have learned so far about the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some questions that a client may ask. Whether they can be answered needs to be critically examined.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Question__: We have been collecting purchase data for 2 weeks now, and we would like to examine whether our users like chocolate or hard candy.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer__: This is hard to answer since 2 weeks of data does not account for seasonality and sales campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Question__: What do our users feel when they put an item in their shopping basket?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer__: We do not yet possess the technology to infer feelings from event logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there are questions that are unlikely to be answered successfully. This may not be clear from the outset.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Question__: Can you predict sales date for Quarter 1/2018, given sales data for the  the past 10 Quarter 1 numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer__: It depends on whether an appropriate and robust model can be found. It also depends on whether the future can be predicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Question__: We have had a data loss in August and September, can you still perform an A/B test analysis using partial data for October?\n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer__: It depends on whether the amount of data is enough to get to a statistically significant result.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is our takeaway here?\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a result could not be found: __Be upfront about it__\n",
    "- If a result was found: __Be transparent about result quality__\n",
    "- If you achieve a great result: __Celebrate!__\n",
    "\n",
    "Giving the client feedback when you have good results encourages them to improve their data quality even further. It also lets them know what kind of questions you can answer. This will create a positive feedback cycle between you and your client and will ensure a long and fruitful collaboration."

    "\n",
    "## 3.1. Separate Setup and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every notebook that I write can be divided in two big parts: the __setup__ and the __analysis__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __setup__ is concerned with\n",
    "\n",
    "- reading in data,\n",
    "- selecting rows by date ranges,\n",
    "- joining user records,\n",
    "- performing QA sampling of the data,\n",
    "- counting the total amount of data that was read,\n",
    "- setting up distributed workers,\n",
    "- performing group bys,\n",
    "- and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize: it is everything that a good data scientist requires to become productive with data. What it should not contain is the actual __analysis__.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my experience, someone who is just interested in results will not immediately spot the difference between an IPython cell that produces an insightful result, and a line that just imports Matplotlib. This has nothing to do with a lack of tech skills. It has everything to do with the fact that a reader is interested in seeing the results first, and reading through code second. This is why I strongly believe that separating those two concerns in a document is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the __setup__ step uses code to retrieve and prepare data, the __analysis__ step uses data and code to generate insight. Here the density of code should be as low as possible. If you can restrict yourself to 1 line of code per insight that you generate, you will produce a lean and easy to read notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a guideline, I recommend refactoring commonly used data transformations into __setup__ subsections. So for example, if you catch yourself writing\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "purchase_segment_hist(df, 50)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What you'll gain is additional clarity in the __analysis__ phase for the small price of four additional lines of code in the __setup__ phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use the following rule of thumb: If you can, put all your code into the __setup__ phase and all your insight into the __analysis__ phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "While no __analysis__ will be completely free of code, minimizing the amount of it will increase readability of results. Having all critical code in the __setup__ phase will ease maintenance and understandability of data processing code."

    "On the phone, you start hearing your client flipping through a paper document and realize that they are looking at a printed version of your notebook. So it would be useless to tell them to _scroll down to the middle_. What do you do? If you add sections and a table of content, nothing will be easier than that. You can simply tell them that the important number can be found in section __2.3.4__. And this is exactly what happened to me countless times and was always quickly resolved because I have made sure to structure my notebooks. To make everyone's lives easier, it is important to add the following structural elements to your data science notebook\n",

    "\n",
    "One important step in creating transparent and easy to evaluate notebooks is taking extra care when loading and processing data. Throughout my work I have identified two important qualities that can be found in a clean notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Reproducibility__: Data is read in as cleanly as possible data and results are calculated deterministically.\n",
    "- __Transparency__: Parse errors, imprecisions and compounding errors are transparently communicated \n",

    "If our whole processing pipeline creates __reproducible__ results, we have a system that we can trust and count on even when we are in a hurry. We can easily create additional notebooks that use the same data, and we can reliably compare results from different notebooks using the same data foundation. It also allows us to rerun notebooks, for example after adding a new chart, and trust that the results will look the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "While __reproducibility__ is concerned with how results are computed, __transparency__ creates trust between a data scientist and a notebook's reader. __Transparency__ allows both parties to understand how results come to be and how to evaluate them. In a __transparent__ document we explain what could be processed and what could not be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how these three qualities can be implemented in the following sections."

    "## 4.1. What data was used? What period was observed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most important factor in cleanly and __transparently__ processing your data is to exactly document:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The start and end date of the data you analyse.\n",
    "2. How you filter data by date ranges.\n",
    "3. File paths, S3 paths, and similar, that you import data from.\n",
    "4. The amount of data rows you read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing this information allows you to compare notebook results to other notebooks that have been created with the same data.\n",

    "Depending on confidentiality requirements, it is not always possible to include file paths in notebooks. Documenting the exact source of data is useful. It allows the reader of a notebook to immediately notice if outdated data was used. Perhaps the company has loaded new data into the data warehouse and did not yet have a chance to inform you. If your results deviate from what is expected, it becomes an easy fix.\n",

    "Data cleaning needs to be __reproducible__. It is crucial to be as precise and intentional as possible when selecting and processing data. A common process for data analysis is to pull CSV, JSON or similar data from a Data Warehouse, pre-process it to a binary format like parquet, and then use it in the actual data analysis notebook. This is done for the reason that this intermediate result can then be reused in multiple notebooks.\n",

    "__Pre-Processing__ could subtly change data that was analysed.

    "__Parsing__ columns can make a big difference. Always be aware of the data format each column is supposed to have. Let your client know of any issues that you encounter while parsing data.
