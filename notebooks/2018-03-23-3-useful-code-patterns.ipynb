    "\n",
    "Over the years I have found out how important it is to constantly keep challenging yourself. Coding can be seen as craftsmanship. A good craftsman will always try to improve the toolbox that they use everyday to perform their work. Code Patterns belong to any good toolbox and when used wisely allow anyone to clearly communicate the intent of their program to both humans and machines. Code is not only something that is executed by a machine but it is also something that is read, understood and maintained by humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the programming patterns out there can serve to make code better for both man and machine. Better in this case means that the program is\n",
    "\n",
    "- easy to understand,\n",
    "- easy to extend, and\n",
    "- easy to fix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better code at the same time, from a machine perspective, also is\n",
    "\n",
    "- fast to run,\n",
    "- reliably handles errors and exceptions, and\n",
    "- efficiently uses your computer's available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to share with you three powerful programming patterns in Python and similar dynamic object-oriented programming languages that can make a big difference and improve your code. Documents like the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) or the [Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) give many useful hints on improving your code's ability to communicate intent. The following code patterns can be seen as my personal favorites and can be found one way or another in many of the coding guidelines out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Flat, not nested\n",
    "\n",
    "The _Zen of Python_ tells you that\n",
    "\n",
    "> Flat is better than nested\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind flat code being better than nested code is that both in terms of how deeply woven your program's function call graph is and from from a practical point of view how far indented your code ends up being, emphasising a sparse use of _nestedness_ will always lead to better code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind flat code being better than nested code is that layering too many paths of execution in your functions can make them hard to understand. Many paths of execution obscure the _main_ path a program will take 99 % of the time and can distract by displaying the minutiae of error handling or data processing with the same priority as the 2 or 3 lines of code that do most of the productive heavy-lifting in a given piece of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a fictitious example involving a web backend that can update user account data after performing a series of validations and input data verifications. In this example, the last step, updating user account data, can only happen if all the previous steps execute correctly."
